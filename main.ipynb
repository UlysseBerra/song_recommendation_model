    "# Music Recommendation System Project\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will build a music recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a model that can recommend music based on similarity with another song the user inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a large dataset in CSV format containing information about music tracks. This dataset includes features such as artists, album name, danceability, energy, and genre, among others. We will try to find the best way to make accurate recommendations, through exploring the data carefully, choosing the right features to use, and finally trying and comparing the accuracy of different algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset."
